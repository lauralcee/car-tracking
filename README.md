# Car Tracking
[Car tracking](https://v3smarttech.com/gps-tracking-singapore/) are small, portable devices that allow a car owner to monitor and locate their car when needed. They also have the potential to offer instant location, speed, and direction data.
If you want to secretly track a vehicle, then you need a covert GPS tracker, like the PT8100. This is a real-time portable battery powered GPS tracker than can be hidden practically anywhere in the vehicle to give you the real-time location of the vehicle.
